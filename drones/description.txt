This is simple code inspired by task in Google Hashcode Qualification Round 2016.
Codes provides simple simulation calculation, based on input data received.

Code saves two files: 
- result.txt - this would be subject to judge system in hashcode (not executed though)
- simulation.txt - big matrix where rows are ticks and columns describe activities that drones make
Additionally, set of information is provided to console.

As mentioned algorithm is simple:
- drone takes order
- drone checks if has capacity
- drone looks for nearest warehouse with a single product that can be taken (i.e. its taking would not exceed drone maximum capacity)
- in warehouse drone takes as many products as possible, namely:
  are present in warehouse
  do not exceed maximum capacity
  Simple greedy algorithm is used, no special features
  
- if there is still capacity, drones looks for new warehouse
- otherwise drone flies to order location, to deliver products

- if there are still not delivered products in order, these are used to seek for new warehouse (and then repeat furthere steps)
- otherwise new order is picked up and process starts from the beginning
